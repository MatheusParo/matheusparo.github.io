            My experience at OpenTabs was one of growth as I learnt all about web development from zero by myself. I learnt from the best of web development tools, such as HTML, CSS, PHP, file management systems and other database management tools such as SQL and JavaScript. This was very important as it served as the foundation for the further iterations of the Extension and Website.
